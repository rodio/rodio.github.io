Hi, I'm ...

... Rodion Borovyk. I am a software developer.

I am currently working on Mapstic, my project dedicated to rendering geographical maps. You can find its code on
my GitHub.

All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act
towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.

My GPG key ID is `7E0E7E4BBBAADEC3`
